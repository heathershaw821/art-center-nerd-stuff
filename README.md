## Robotics Fundamentals

### Week 1: Assembly & Orientation

* **Day 1:** Build the chassis. Identify each part and what it does.
* **Day 2:** Finish building. Power test. Upload a ‚Äúblink‚Äù to confirm wiring works.

### Week 2: Arduino and Robotics Concepts Overview

- **Day 1:** Intro to what Arduino is, serial basics: `Serial.print()`, Hello World, debugging.
  - [What is Arduino and can I use it for my project?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSx6k-zXlLE)
  - [What is Serial.begin(9600)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GX5brSZ_1E)
- **Day 2:** Video presentation + lecture on robotics funamental concepts
  - [An Introduction To Robotics ü§ñ By Teach Kids Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvMQONnCXbE)
  - [Valkyrie: NASA's Superhero Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE-YBaYjbqY)


### Week 3: Sensors and Servos

- **Day 1:** How servo motors work
  - [Controlling Self Driving Cars](https://youtu.be/4Y7zG48uHRo)
- **Day 2:** Ultrasonic sensors
  - [Ultrasonic Sensor Module](https://youtu.be/KGwtit2bFyo)

### Week 4: Motors, Remote Control, and the bridge between controlled and semi-autonomous machines

- **Day 1:** Read IR remote signals using a library. Print codes to Serial Monitor. Learn about Motor drivers.
  - [How DC GEAR MOTOR Works with ARDUINO and L298N](https://youtu.be/GPVC84D5ULw)
  - [IR Remote with Arduino Uno](https://youtu.be/q97VE3oEwIc)
- **Day 2:** Remote control mode: UP = forward, DOWN = backward, LEFT = spin left, RIGHT = spin right. (Reward = they can drive their robot like an RC car).
  - [How to Make Anything - Learn to Think Like an Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIwTCyu2wS4)

##  Building a *real* robot by adding Raspberry Pi and Learning Python

### Week 5: Raspberry Pi & the separation of decision making from control modules

- **Day 1:** Getting comfortable with what the Raspberry Pi is, and setting up our control interfaces
  - [Linux Command Line for Beginners](https://youtu.be/16d2lHc0Pe8)
- **Day 2:** Introduction to Python: Let's write a program!

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION, MORE TO COME AS OUT TEST GROUP IS OVER

---

# Capstone Project Week (Optional if time allows)

- Teams design **autonomous robot demos**:
  - Maze-solving.
  - Obstacle race.
  - ‚ÄúRobot dance battle‚Äù (sync servo sweeps & motion).
  - Remote-vs-autonomous switch mode.
- Students present their robots, explain their code, and show creativity.

---

# Learning Outcomes

By the end, each student can:

- Assemble and wire a robot from scratch.
- Use **Arduino libraries** (Servo, IRremote, etc.).
- Write modular functions (`forward()`, `scanLeft()`, etc.).
- Implement **sensor-based autonomy** with ultrasonic + servo scanning.
- Debug and troubleshoot using Serial Monitor.
- Create a final project that‚Äôs personal and rewarding.

---

To keep it **rewarding**:

- Every session ends with something **moving or visual** (LED blink, wheel spin, sensor print, robot turning).
- Students **see the robot get smarter** each week: from blinking ‚Üí moving ‚Üí controlled ‚Üí sensing ‚Üí thinking.
