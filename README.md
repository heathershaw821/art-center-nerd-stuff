## Robotics Fundamentals

### Unit 1: Assembly & Orientation

* **Lesson 1:** Build the chassis. Identify each part and what it does.
* **Lesson 2:** Finish building. Power test. Upload a “blink” to confirm wiring works.

### Unit 2: Arduino and Robotics Concepts Overview

- **Lesson 1:** Intro to what Arduino is, serial basics: `Serial.print()`, Hello World, debugging.
  - [What is Arduino and can I use it for my project?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSx6k-zXlLE)
  - [What is Serial.begin(9600)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GX5brSZ_1E)
- **Lesson 2:** Video presentation + lecture on robotics fundamental concepts

### Unit 3: Sensors and Servos

- **Lesson 1:** How servo motors work
  - [Controlling Self Driving Cars](https://youtu.be/4Y7zG48uHRo)
- **Lesson 2:** Ultrasonic sensors

### Unit 4: Motors, Remote Control, and the bridge between controlled and semi-autonomous machines

- **Lesson 1:** Read IR remote signals using a library. Print codes to Serial Monitor. Learn about motor drivers.
  - [How DC GEAR MOTOR Works with ARDUINO and L298N](https://youtu.be/GPVC84D5ULw)
  - [IR Remote with Arduino Uno](https://youtu.be/q97VE3oEwIc)
- **Lesson 2:** Remote control mode: UP = forward, DOWN = backward, LEFT = spin left, RIGHT = spin right.  
  *(Reward = they can drive their robot like an RC car).*

## Building a *real* robot by adding Raspberry Pi and Learning Python

### Unit 1: Raspberry Pi & the separation of decision making from control modules

- **Lesson 1:** Getting comfortable with what the Raspberry Pi / Linux are, and setting up our control interfaces
  - [What Is Linux? - Explained for Beginners](https://youtu.be/eQbIxEw3AI0)
  - [Linux Command Line for Beginners](https://youtu.be/16d2lHc0Pe8)
  - [Online Linux Terminal and Playground](https://labex.io/tutorials/linux-online-linux-playground-372915)
- **Lesson 2:** Introduction to Python: Let's write a program!

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION, MORE TO COME AS OUR TEST GROUP CONTINUES

---

# Capstone Project

- Teams design **autonomous robot demos**:
  - Maze-solving.
  - Obstacle race.
  - “Robot dance battle” (sync servo sweeps & motion).
  - Remote-vs-autonomous switch mode.
- Students present their robots, explain their code, and show creativity.

---

# Learning Outcomes

By the end, each student can:

-

To keep it **rewarding**:

- Every session ends with something **moving or visual** (LED blink, wheel spin, sensor print, robot turning).
- Students **see the robot get smarter** each unit: from blinking → moving → controlled → sensing → thinking.
